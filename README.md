# Multilingual-Sentiment-Analysis-And-Fake-Review-Detection
AI-powered multilingual sentiment analysis and fake review detection system. Uses mBERT for sentiment classification, RoBERTa for AI-generated review detection, CLIP for image verification, and XGBoost to generate a 0–100% authenticity score for e-commerce reviews.

## Project Overview

E-commerce platforms such as Amazon, Flipkart, and Meesho depend heavily on customer reviews to guide purchasing decisions. However, the increasing number of fake, paid, bot-generated, and AI-generated reviews has significantly reduced customer trust. This project is an application-based AI system designed to evaluate the trustworthiness of product reviews by analyzing multilingual text, detecting AI-generated content, verifying attached images, and combining these insights into a single Authenticity Score.

## Problem Statement

The primary challenge addressed in this project is the lack of an automated system capable of handling the complexities of the Indian e-commerce ecosystem.

* Traditional sentiment analysis tools handle only English, making them ineffective for reviews written in Hindi, Gujarati, Tamil, Telugu, Bengali, Marathi, etc..


* Customers frequently upload photos, but many may be stock photos, unrelated images, or AI-generated visuals meant to falsely influence buyers.


* Current platforms display reviews without evaluating their trustworthiness, making customers vulnerable to misinformation.



## Key Modules & Proposed Solution

This project utilizes a four-step pipeline using advanced NLP and computer vision models:

1. 
**Multilingual Sentiment Analysis (mBERT):** * Utilizes Multilingual BERT (mBERT) to process reviews written in various Indian languages.


* Classifies the emotional tone of each review as Positive, Neutral, or Negative.




2. 
**AI-Generated Review Detection (RoBERTa):** * Deploys a RoBERTa-based model to detect whether a review is human-written or generated by Large Language Models (like ChatGPT or Gemini).


* Identifies low-perplexity, repetitive, or machine-like text patterns.




3. 
**Photo Review Verification (CLIP):** * Employs the CLIP model to compute semantic similarity between the review text and the uploaded product image.


* Identifies whether the image is real, AI-generated, stock, unrelated, or mismatched.




4. 
**Final Authenticity Score (XGBoost):** * Combines outputs from mBERT, RoBERTa, and CLIP with metadata using an XGBoost classifier.


* Produces a final Authenticity Score (0–100%) to help buyers quickly understand how trustworthy each review is.





## Datasets

The system trains and validates on the following targeted datasets to ensure accuracy across modules:

* **Fake Review Dataset:** Used for training and validating the detection models to identify deceptive, spam, and machine-generated reviews.
* **Equal Sentiment Dataset:** Utilized to ensure balanced training for the sentiment analysis module across various emotional tones (Positive, Neutral, Negative).

## Deployment Strategy

The final system is designed for real-time application deployment through two main interfaces:

 
**Chrome Extension:** Extracts reviews directly from product pages, processes text and images via a backend API, and displays the Authenticity Score on the website.


 
**Web Application:** A Flask or Streamlit interface where users can paste reviews, upload images, and receive a detailed breakdown of sentiment, AI detection, and image verification.
